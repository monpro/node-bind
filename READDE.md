# Node Bind

Node Bind is a powerful library for Node.js designed to enable robust and dynamic property binding. Inspired by JavaBeans property binding, Node Allow offers features like two-way binding, deep object binding, and lifecycle event hooks.

## Features

- **Two-Way Binding:** Synchronize the values between two properties automatically.
- **Deep Object Binding:** Watch and react to changes deep within an object.
- **Binding Groups:** Manage and manipulate groups of bindings collectively.
- **Lifecycle Hooks:** Add custom behavior on binding, change, and unbind events.
- **Efficient Cleanup:** Automatically unbind properties to prevent memory leaks.
